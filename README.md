# Deep Learning Object Detection Plugin

This plugin provides tools to perform object detection using Deep Learning.

Object detection consists in detecting the location and class of several
objects in a same image.

The plugin comes with four recipes and a macro.

# Macro

### Download pre-trained detection model

This macro downloads a pre-trained model in your project. For now only the RetinaNet
architecture pre-trained on the COCO dataset is available.

### Create scoring api service

This macro create a scoring api endpoint from the model folder.

# Recipes

### Fine-tune detection model

This recipe does *transfer learning* and *finetuning* to adapt a pretrained model
on a new dataset.

There are 2 ways how you can define the inputs for the retrain recipe:
- By storing them each in a separate column: `x1`,`y1`,`x2`,`y2`,`label` and providing those column names in a recipe settings
- By storing the bounding boxes in a column as a JSON string with the following fields: `top`, `left`, `width`, `height`, `label`

### Detect objects

This recipe detects objects in images and produce a dataset storing all the
detected objects with their class and localization.

### Display bounding boxes

This recipe given objects localization, draw on images a bounding box around the
objects.

### Detect objects in video

This recipe detect objects in a video and produces a copy of the video with the
objects drawed on it.

If `ffmpeg` is installed the video will be of the mp4 format, else of the mkv format.
To install `ffmpeg`, you can use the following command:

- On Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`
- On MacOs: `brew install ffmpeg`
